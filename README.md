# WikiTruth

WikiTruth is a Flask web application designed to compare Wikipedia articles across different languages using AI to identify factual discrepancies and differences in information presentation.

## Features

- Search for Wikipedia articles in multiple languages
- Compare multiple language versions of the same article
- View comparisons in three different modes:
  - **Summary Mode**: Shows key factual discrepancies in a concise format
  - **Full Differences**: Provides a comprehensive comparison of the entire articles
  - **Funny Mode**: Gives a humorous, sarcastic take on the differences
- Export comparison results to various formats
- Share comparisons via social media and email
- Support for 30+ languages
  

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Scraping**: Trafilatura for improved text extraction
- **AI**: Puter.js for AI-powered comparisons
- **Data Source**: Wikipedia API
